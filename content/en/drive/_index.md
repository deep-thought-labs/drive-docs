Drive is a decentralized infrastructure management tool that enables users to deploy and manage blockchain nodes, services, and protocols on their own systems—whether local machines, personal servers, or their own internet infrastructure.

When combined with other independent users running Drive, it creates a synchronized super-mesh of services, protocols, and chains, forming a distributed infrastructure network managed entirely by independent users. Drive empowers individuals to participate in and contribute to a decentralized ecosystem while maintaining full control over their infrastructure.
