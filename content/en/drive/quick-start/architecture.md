Drive is a collection of pre-configured Docker container services ready to use. Each service is a self-contained Docker image that comes with all necessary configurations already set up.

## How Drive Works

Drive provides you with a catalog of services—such as blockchain nodes and web servers—that you can start, stop, and manage at your discretion. You have complete control over:

- **Which services are active** - Start only the services you need, when you need them
- **Service configurations** - Each service comes pre-configured, but you can customize settings as needed
- **Your persistent data** - All data generated by services belongs to you and stays on your system

## Your Data, Your Control

All persistent data created by Drive services remains on your system and is never shared:

- **Blockchain node data** - Your blockchain synchronization data, keys, and node state are stored locally
- **Web server content** - Any websites, files, or configurations you host are yours alone
- **Service configurations** - Your custom settings and preferences stay private

You maintain full ownership and control over everything Drive creates on your system.
