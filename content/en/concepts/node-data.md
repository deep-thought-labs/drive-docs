**Node data** is all the information that a blockchain node stores for its operation, including configuration files, cryptographic keys, blockchain data, and synchronization state.

## What is Node Data?

Node data comprises all the files and directories that the node needs to operate:

- **Configuration files** - Node operation parameters
- **Cryptographic keys** - Node and validator identities
- **Genesis file** - Initial state of the blockchain
- **Blockchain database** - History of blocks and transactions
- **Application state** - Current state of the blockchain
- **Logs and temporary data** - Debugging and operation information

## Node Data Location

In Drive, node data is stored in the `persistent-data` directory:

- **Host path:** `./persistent-data/` (relative to the service directory)
- **Container path:** `/home/ubuntu/.infinited/`

### Directory Structure

```
persistent-data/
├── config/              # Configuration files
│   ├── config.toml      # General node configuration
│   ├── app.toml         # Application configuration
│   ├── client.toml      # Client configuration
│   ├── genesis.json     # Network genesis file
│   └── priv_validator_key.json  # Validator key
├── data/                # Blockchain database
│   ├── blocks/          # Downloaded blocks
│   ├── state.db/        # State database
│   └── application.db   # Application database
└── keyring-file/        # Keyring (account cryptographic keys)
    └── ...              # Encrypted key files
```

**Note:** Node logs are stored in a separate directory:
- **Container path:** `/var/log/node/`
- **Host path:** `./persistent-data/logs/` (if mapped as a volume)

## Node Data Components

### Configuration Files

Configuration files are created during [node initialization]({{< relref "node-initialization" >}}) and define how the node operates:

- **`config.toml`** - Network, consensus, and P2P configuration
- **`app.toml`** - Blockchain application configuration
- **`client.toml`** - Client configuration for interactions

### Cryptographic Keys

Keys are generated during initialization and are critical for the node's identity:

- **[Private Validator Key]({{< relref "private-validator-key" >}})** (`priv_validator_key.json`) - Identifies the validator, located in `config/`
- **Node Key** - Identifies the node on the P2P network, automatically generated
- **Consensus Key** - Key for consensus, automatically generated

**Note:** Account keys are stored in the [keyring]({{< relref "keyring" >}}) in `keyring-file/`, not in `config/`.

### Genesis File

The [genesis file]({{< relref "genesis-file" >}}) defines the initial state of the blockchain and is downloaded during initialization.

### Blockchain Database

The database stores:

- **Block history** - All synchronized blocks
- **Transactions** - Transaction history
- **Application state** - Current state of the blockchain
- **Indexes** - For fast searches

## Data Persistence

Node data is stored in the `persistent-data` directory which is mounted as a persistent volume in Docker. This means that:

- **Data persists** between container restarts
- **Data is shared** between host and container
- **Data is backed up** automatically if you backup the `persistent-data` directory

## Importance of Node Data

Node data is critical because:

- **Contains node identity** - Keys define who the node is
- **Enables synchronization** - The database stores the blockchain state
- **Enables validation** - The validator needs its Private Validator Key to sign blocks
- **Enables recovery** - With the correct data, you can restore the node

## Cleaning Node Data

In some cases, you need to clean node data:

- **Reinitialize the node** - To change the initialization mode
- **Resolve synchronization issues** - To start from scratch
- **Change networks** - To connect to a different network

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ Warning: Cleaning Data**
>
> Cleaning node data removes:
> - All synchronized blocks
> - Application state
> - Keys (if not backed up)
>
> **Make sure you have backups** before cleaning data, especially if you're a validator.

For more information on how to delete node data, see [Delete Node Data]({{< relref "../drive/guides/blockchain-nodes/delete-node-data" >}}).

## Node Data Backup

For validators, it's critical to backup:

- **Private Validator Key** - `priv_validator_key.json` (or the seed phrase if you used recovery)
- **Configuration files** - To restore custom configuration

For full nodes, it's generally not necessary to backup data, as it can be regenerated by synchronizing with the network.
