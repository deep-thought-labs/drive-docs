Atomic concept files that explain fundamental technologies and concepts used throughout the documentation. These concepts are reusable and can be referenced from any part of the documentation.

## Available Concepts

- [Key]({{< relref "key" >}}) - What is a cryptographic key and what it's used for in blockchains
- [Keyring]({{< relref "keyring" >}}) - Secure storage of cryptographic keys for on-chain operations
- [Keyring vs Private Validator Key]({{< relref "keyring-vs-validator-key" >}}) - Detailed differences between both components
- [Node Initialization]({{< relref "node-initialization" >}}) - What is initialization and what components it creates
- [Genesis File]({{< relref "genesis-file" >}}) - What is the genesis file and its purpose
- [Node Data]({{< relref "node-data" >}}) - What is node data and where it's stored
- [Private Validator Key]({{< relref "private-validator-key" >}}) - Cryptographic identity of the validator
