Documentation on operations directly related to the Infinite Improbability Drive blockchain.

## What is this section?

This section contains guides for performing operations directly on the blockchain, including:

- **Genesis Operations**: Create gentxs, validate and work with genesis files
- **On-Chain Transactions**: Create validators, delegate tokens, transfers
- **Governance**: Create proposals, vote, query proposals
- **Chain Operations**: Chain launch, updates, parameters
- **Queries**: Query account information, validators, staking, network

## Difference with Drive

- **Drive**: How to use Drive as a tool to manage nodes and services
- **Blockchain**: Operations directly with the chain (transactions, genesis, governance)
