Overview of blockchain node services, their common structure, and how they differ only in configuration values.

All blockchain nodes share the same Docker image and structure, differing only in configuration values (chain ID, genesis file, ports, etc.). See the [Service Catalog]({{< relref "../catalog" >}}) for the complete list of available blockchain node services.
